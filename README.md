If you are not familiar with Faraday make sure to check out the [Faraday](https://faradayrf.com/faraday/) page we've setup. This simple yet powerful radio is part of our [master plan](https://faradayrf.com/faradayrf-master-plan/)

Developers interested in helping shape the future of ham radio should see our [contributors](https://github.com/FaradayRF/Faraday-Software/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) page. We are appreciative for the enthusiasm and help. Ham radio is an exciting hobby which provides a medium to learn and apply digital communications. Let's do this!

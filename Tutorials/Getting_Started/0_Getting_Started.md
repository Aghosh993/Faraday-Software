#Getting Started With Faraday

Faraday is a wireless digital radio for amateur radio experimenters and operators for the 33cm band (902-928MHz). This "Getting Started" guide will introduce you to the basic functions and operations to get your Faraday on the air from an operating point of view. Additional tutorials focus more closely on developing with Faraday.

## Faraday - The 33cm Amateur Radio Band

The [FaradayRF Master Plan](https://faradayrf.com/faradayrf-master-plan/) details the reasoning behind many of our engineering design trades; We aim to provide a well documented and educational digital wireless ham radio platform enabling an infrastructure to be built.

### Education

At the core of FaradayRF's mission is education. Design, projects, and documentation are focused on providing the community a means to learn and grow while enabling a base level of functionality out of the box. All base applications are considered educational content and serve as great examples of the simple applications that can be develop and over-viewing the skill-sets needed to complete them. 

## Tutorial Agenda

This tutorial series will encompass:

* First Steps - Setting Up Faraday
* Running Faraday's Proxy Server
* Operating Faraday Base Applications
  * Telemetry/Command
  * Messaging
  * File Transfer
  * APRS-IS Interconnect

## CC430 Programming (MSP430 - Embedded C)

Note: The CC430 contains a higher level MSp430 than the original launchpad. The programming tools, style, and general topology are identical but specifics in register settings and other details are different.

Creating the basic version of the core messaging application will create:

- A simple TX/RX point to point message application using the experimental command function
- A single application that performed TX and RX
- Unlimited message length


NOTES:
- This needs to be updated with new proxy eventually 
- Using the experimental command RF packet forward functionality is a means to create the simple application in a tutorial/engineering method. This is very sub-optimal but can simply be moved over to its own application buffers and greatly improve performance.

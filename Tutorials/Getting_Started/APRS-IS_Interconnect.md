#APRS-IS Interconnect

The APRS-IS Interconnect program is a telemetry program that converts high-speed and high accuracy telemetry content into APRS system compatible data. The program provides the data parsing and logic to connect with the APRS-IS system. At the core of the FaradayRF mission is to also minimize interoperability issues within the amateur radio hobby. Data is data.

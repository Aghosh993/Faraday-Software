# Tutorial - Message

This tutorial implements a basic version of the core messaging application using the command application experimental RF packet forward functionality.
 
** Key Goals Achieved **

* A simple TX/RX point to point message application using the experimental command function
* A single application that performed TX and RX
* Unlimited message length


## Note
* This needs to be updated with new proxy eventually 
* Using the experimental command RF packet forward functionality is a means to create the simple application in a tutorial/engineering method. This is very sub-optimal but can simply be moved over to its own application buffers and greatly improve performance.

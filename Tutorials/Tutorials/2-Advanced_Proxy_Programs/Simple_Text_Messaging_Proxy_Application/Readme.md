# Tutorial - Simple Text Messaging Proxy Application 

The previous tutorial created a simple messaging application that utilized the Faraday  proxy interface and directly coupled a simple user interface. Proper applications should implement a more modular approach by separating the user interface from core application, ideally using a RESTful interface (FLASK).




#Running The Tutorial Example Script

## Start The Proxy Interface

Following the [Configuring Proxy](../../0-Welcome_To_Faraday/Configuring_Proxy/) tutorial configure, start, and ensure a successful connection to **BOTH** locally (USB) connected Faraday digital radios.

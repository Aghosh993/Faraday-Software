# Base Application - File Transfer

Transferring binary data (file, image, audio, etc...) is exactly the same methodologies at transmitting a text message except inserting the intended data bytes instead of ASCII text. This application builds on the text messaging application to enable this functionality. Basic data transfer, error detection and correction, and flow control are implemented.

## Key Topics

* Packet Fragmentation
* Data Encapsulation
* Error Detection
* Automatic Retry-Request Algorithms (ARQ)

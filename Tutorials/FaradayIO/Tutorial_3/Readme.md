# Tutorial 0 Overview

This tutorial shows the  basic usage of a simple single packet experimental RF transmission command. This functionality provided by the built-in command application running on Faraday's CC430 provides a simple way to experiments with generic RF packets between two Faraday units.

Although TX/RX is achieved it is not optimized for speed, error detection/correction, or other variables. It is however extremely easy and useful. This tutorial will build a basic messaging application functionality using the experimental RF packet forwarding functionality to be later modified into a separate "messaging" application later.

## Note

* This will implement the current single unit proxy but SHOULD BE UPDATED TO USE A SINGLE PROXY in the production release version.
